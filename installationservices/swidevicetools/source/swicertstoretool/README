swicertstoretool
================

swicertstoretool is a tool for creating the SWI cert store data file containing
the root certificates used by software install.  

Command syntax
--------------

The syntax of the command is:

swicertstoretool INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE LOG_FILE

INPUT_FILE is a text file describing the certificates to be put in the store.
The format is described below.

OUTPUT_FILE is where the cert store data file is written.  This will need to be
copied to where the SWI cert store expects to find it,
z:\resource\swicertstore.dat.

LOG_FILE names a file that information is logged to when the command is run.
This should be checked afterwards to see if the command succeeded.  Errors are
indicated by lines starting with "***".
